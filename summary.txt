1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
I chose Python as my language. I have more experience with full stack web developement using c# for the backend, but since 
it was not necessarily listed (most similar to Java), I took the safe route. Also, I am learning Python currently for data
science purposes, so I wanted to challenge myself to apply my knowledge of building c# apis to learn how to use Flask to 
build a simple Python web app. Flask was perfect for this because it is a microframework for web applications. 
I chose to use itemgetter because it is easier to read then a lambda function when sorting.
